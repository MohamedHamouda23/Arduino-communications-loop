# 🔆 Optical Communication & Sensor Control System Using Arduino Uno R3

## 🔧 Project Overview

This project implements an **optical communication system** using a white LED 💡 as the transmitter and a photoresistor 🌞 as the receiver. The system creates a basic wireless data link using light signals and is built on the **Arduino Uno R3** 🛠️.

Alongside the core optical communication, two additional sensor-based subsystems are integrated:

- 🎮 **Joystick-Controlled Fan Movement**  
  A joystick module controls the speed and direction of a small fan motor 🌬️ in real-time.

- 📡 **Ultrasonic Sensor Distance Measurement**  
  An ultrasonic sensor measures distance 📏 and displays the results live on an LCD screen 🖥️.



## ✅ Core Requirements

- Use an Arduino Uno R3 starter kit or anything equivalent include:

## 📐 Wiring Diagrams

To recreate or expand this project:

1. Follow the wiring diagrams and hardware list. Reference diagrams to help replicate the project can be found in the [`diagrams`](./diagrams/) folder.
2. Write Arduino code to process incoming signals, control the fan, and display sensor data.



## 📌 Notes

- All components and mini-projects are integrated into a **single Arduino Uno R3**.
- Adjust the **photoresistor threshold** depending on ambient lighting to ensure accurate data reception.
- The project uses **nearly all available pins** on the Arduino Uno. Consider using an **Arduino Mega** for more expandability.
- The wiring diagrams provided are **representational**, not the exact ones used in the original implementation.
- No full video or official schematic exists, as this was a **university project** with constraints.
- ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: All diagrams and logic included in this repository are **based on examples from the official Arduino website**. They are **not specific to this exact project**, but they can be adapted with **appropriate pin adjustments**.
