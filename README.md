# Arduino Optical Communications Loop Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for **optical communications loop** using a single Arduino board with an LED and photoresistor 


## 🔧 Project Overview

The core of the project is an **optical communications system** where an LED transmits data, and a photoresistor receives it. This forms the basis for several additional mini-projects where sensor data is transmitted optically and used to control outputs on the receiver side.



## 🧠 Assignment Requirements

### ✅ Core Requirements
- Build and demonstrate a working **optical communication loop** (LED → photoresistor).
- Use a 9-byte communication message format.
- All hardware must be pre-wired and ready for demo without live reprogramming.




## 🛠️ Hardware Used
- 🔌 26 wires  
- 🔀 2 jumper wires  
- 🌞 Photoresistor  
- 💡 White LED  
- 🟫 Breadboard  
- 🥤 Straw (optional)  
- 🌬️ Fan and its motor including wires  
- 🛠️ Arduino Uno R3  
- 🖥️ LCD  
- 🎮 Joystick  
- 📡 Ultrasonic sensor  
- 🔌 USB cable  
- 🎚️ Potentiometer  
- ⚡ Three resistors:  
  - 220 Ω (2)  
  - 100k Ω (1)  





## 📜 Notes

- Mini-projects should work **simultaneously** on one board.
- For any custom communication protocol, include detailed documentation in code comments or a separate report.
- Focus on reliability and clear documentation for better marks.
