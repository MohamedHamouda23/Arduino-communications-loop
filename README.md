# Arduino Optical Communications Loop Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for **optical communications loop** using a single Arduino board with an LED and photoresistor 

---

## 🔧 Project Overview

The core of the project is an **optical communications system** where an LED transmits data, and a photoresistor receives it. This forms the basis for several additional mini-projects where sensor data is transmitted optically and used to control outputs on the receiver side.

---

## 🧠 Assignment Requirements

### ✅ Core Requirements
- Build and demonstrate a working **optical communication loop** (LED → photoresistor).
- Use a 9-byte communication message format.
- All hardware must be pre-wired and ready for demo without live reprogramming.

## 🛠️ Hardware Used



---
## 📜 Notes

- Mini-projects should work **simultaneously** on one board.
- For any custom communication protocol, include detailed documentation in code comments or a separate report.
- Focus on reliability and clear documentation for better marks.
